# A-Algorithm-Optimization
Implementation of different optimized a* algorithm
This project is to test the efficiency, use of memory and the running time between different optimization of A* algorithm. 
We design a map generator which can randomly generate map with blocks, highways, and traffic ways. 
By randomly selecting a start point and a destination, general A* algorithm can show the best path from the start to the destination. 
And we also apply the Uniform-cost Algorithm, weighted A* with different weight value to test their use of memory, steps cost, and the running time.
